# AmazonBuyBot
I developed this bot to buy GPU for cryptomining from Amazon.
As you know, MSRP graphics card cannot be found worldwide.
Selenium based bot doesn't have any UI. It is a console app. It can scan some keywords in a link that you put. It has a few version one of them is automatically buy the product via buy now button. And the other one is send the product link to you over telegram.
