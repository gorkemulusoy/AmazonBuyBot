I developed this bot to buy GPU for cryptomining from Amazon. 
As you know, MSRP graphics card cannot be found worldwide. 
Selenium based bot doesn't have any UI. It is a console app. 
It can scan some keywords in a link that you put. It has a few version one of them is automatically buy the product via buy now button. 
And the other one is send the product link to you over telegram. You can use to track any item in any Amazon which goods sold out in seconds. 
If you want you can write a UI to public usage.
